About the game:
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is an international television game show. Contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions â€“ only one contestant plays at a time; The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is an aspirational value in local currency, such as one million pounds in the U.K. or 70 million rupees (7 crore) in India.
At its core, the game is a quiz competition in which the goal is to correctly answer a series of fifteen consecutive multiple-choice questions. The questions are of increasing difficulty. Each question is worth a specific amount of money; the amounts are not cumulative. If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced to $0 for tier-one questions, $1,000 for tier-two questions, and $32,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.
